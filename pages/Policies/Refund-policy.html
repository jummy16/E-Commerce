    <h1>Refund policy</h1>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>This Policy forms part of the Customer Terms and Conditions, and so words defined in the Terms and Conditions have the same meaning in this Policy, unless the context indicates otherwise. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit your statutory rights in any way.


        <ul>You may return any product that you bought from the Website or iStore if:</ul>
        
       <li>you’ve changed your mind;</li>
       <li>you purchased the wrong item;</li>
       <li>the iStore product is an unwanted gift;</li>
       <li>the iStore products has a technical fault; or</li>
       <li>you have concerns about the quality of the product (the “Returned Product”).</li>
        </p>
    <h4>2. Products that are you purchased incorrectly or that are unwanted</h4>
    <p>This Policy forms part of the Customer Terms and Conditions, and so words defined in the Terms and Conditions have the same meaning in this Policy, unless the context indicates otherwise. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit your statutory rights in any way.

 

       <ul> <b>You can return an unwanted product to iStore, provided:</b></ul>
        
        <li>it is unopened, undamaged and unused, with the original labels and stickers still attached;</li>
        <li> it is not missing any accessories or parts; and</li>
        <li>you return the product to the Store together with the invoice you received from the Store or you log a return on the Website within 7 days of delivery to you or collection by you of the unwanted product. After 7 days, you can only return a product if it is defective.</li>
         
        
        
        Once we have inspected the Returned Product and validated your return form, we will credit your account with the purchase price of the product within 10 days of the return. You may also elect to exchange a Returned Product for another product (the “Exchange Product”) that is of the same value as the Returned Product. If the price of the Returned Product is less than that of the Exchange product, you will be liable to pay the cash difference between the two products.
        
        If the packaging is in any way opened, damaged or tampered with, iStore will charge you a handling fee of up to 20% (twenty percent) of the total purchase price of the Returned Product. If you have entered into a contract with a device financing bank, returning a product bought from iStore will not cancel your contract with the finance company/bank. 
        
        You will continue to be responsible for that contract and for any charges and fees that are associated with that contract. Unsealed software products, software subscriptions, electronic software downloads and electronic voucher downloads, gift cards and in-ear products may not be returned to iStore and are not eligible for refunds. All Returned Products are subject to inspection by the iStore prior to a refund or an exchange.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Products damaged on delivery</h4>
        <p>Should a product be damaged or missing any parts or accessories at the time of delivery, please notify iStore within 7 days of such delivery. Once we have inspected the product and validated your return, we will at your choice repair or replace the product as soon as possible or credit your account with the purchase price of the product.

        </p>

        <h4>4. Faulty Products</h4>
        <p>All iStore products are covered by a manufacturer’s warranty. If your product is faulty you must follow the process set out in the manufacturer’s warranty as indicated to you by the iStore. Please note that any manufacturer’s warranty is subject to whatever terms and conditions the manufacturer may impose. These are usually stated in a brochure or leaflet inside or on the product packaging. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of any such terms and conditions.

            For the avoidance of doubt, the manufacturer’s warranty is provided by the manufacturer and not iStore. Any queries with regards to the warranty should be addressed with the manufacturer and iStore can only facilitate the communication between you and the manufacturer.
            
             </p>

        <h4>5. Refunds</h4>
        <p>Refunds will be done electronically via electronic funds transfer (EFT) to a bank account nominated by you. In certain circumstances where possible, iStore may effect a credit card transaction reversal. Refunds may take up to 14 working days to complete. iStore will not be liable for any bank charges, taxes, interest and/or any other fees that may be levied against you for the refund.
